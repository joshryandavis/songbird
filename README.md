# songbird

Built on a fork of [https://github.com/chickazama/myna](https://github.com/chickazama/myna) which provides most of the
models and methods the Starling Bank API, to which I've added.

Working on a CLI interface to easily access my Starling account data from the terminal. The main feature is the ability
walk through new transactions to categorise and tag them. In the vein of YNAB but without all the other stuff and
Starling only.

Motivated by Starlingâ€™s bad, slow website that logs you out every few minutes and still does not let you see a joint
alongside your personal account.
